# NO FUCKS GIVEN LICENCE (NFGL)
Do with this stuff whatever you want, but do it at your own risk. I'm not going to assume any kind of responsibility for whatever the code, your hardware or your use of it does to make your life miserable. In exchange you can really do whatever you want. You may even print this out and send a copy to the Iranian president. I really don't care.

Oh well, there's one thing: Have a look at the licences of the dependencies pulled by the Maven build file and respect those. No really, you _have_ to do that or somebody will have every right to screw you in the most painful ways you can imagine.
